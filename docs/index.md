## Abstract
Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is widely used in industrial quality control and automation to test the purity and material quality of items. In this research, we propose a novel sensorized end effector and acquisition strategy to capture spectral signatures from objects and register them with a 3D point cloud. Our methodology first takes a 3D scan of an object generated by a time-of-flight depth camera and decomposes the object into a series of planned viewpoints covering the surface. We generate motion plans for a robot manipulator and end-effector to visit these viewpoints while maintaining a fixed distance and surface normal to ensure maximal spectral signal quality enabled by the spherical motion of the end-effector. By continuously acquiring surface reflectance values as the end-effector scans the target object, the autonomous system develops a four-dimensional model of the target object: position in an $R^3$ coordinate frame, and a wavelength vector denoting the associated spectral signature. We demonstrate this system in building spectral-spatial object profiles of increasingly complex geometries. As a point of comparison, we show our proposed system and spectral acquisition planning yields more consistent signal signals than na\"{\i}ve point scanning strategies for capturing spectral information over complex surface geometries. Our work represents a significant step towards high-resolution spectral-spatial sensor fusion for automated quality assessment.
